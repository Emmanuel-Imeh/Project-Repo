**Getting started with the task.**

## SERVER SETUP

### 1. Launch an AWS EC2 Instance

1. [**Sign in to AWS Console:**](https://aws.amazon.com/) Go to the AWS Management Console and sign in to your account.
2. **Navigate to EC2:** In the search bar, type "EC2" and select the EC2 service.
3. **Launch Instance**: Click on "Launch instances."
4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**

- Select an Amazon Linux AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2023 or Amazon Linux 2). These are optimized for AWS and often provide a good balance of performance and compatibility.

5. **Choose an Instance Type:**

- For a simple web server, a t2.micro or t3.micro instance type is usually sufficient and eligible for the AWS Free Tier.

6. **Configure Instance Details:**

- Keep most settings as default unless you have specific requirements.
- Ensure "Auto-assign Public IP" is enabled so your instance gets a public IP address.

7. **Add Storage:**

- The default storage (8GB) is usually enough for a basic web server. You can increase it if needed.

8. **Configure Security Group:** This is crucial for allowing web traffic.

- **Create a new security group** or select an existing one.
- Give it a descriptive name (e.g., cloud-project-team) and a description.
- **Add Inbound Rules:**  
   - SSH (Port 22): This allows you to connect to your instance via SSH.
  Source: My IP (most secure, only allows your current IP) or a specific IP range. Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) for SSH in production for security reasons. - HTTP (Port 80): This allows web traffic to your Nginx server.
  Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for public access. - HTTPS (Port 443): If you plan to serve content over SSL/TLS (highly recommended for production).
  Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for public access.

9. **Create a Key Pair:**

- Choose an existing key pair or create a new one. This .pem file is essential for connecting to your instance via SSH.
- Download the .pem file and keep it secure. You won't be able to download it again.

10. **Launch Instance:** Review your settings and click "Launch instance."

### 2. Connect to Your EC2 Instance

Once your instance is running (its "Instance State" changes to "Running"), you can connect to it.

1. **Get Public IP/DNS:** On the EC2 Instances dashboard, select your instance and copy its Public IPv4 address or Public IPv4 DNS.
2. **Open Terminal/SSH Client:**
   - **Linux/macOS:** Open a terminal.
   - **Windows:** Use Git Bash, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), or a client like PuTTY (if using PuTTY, you'll need to convert your .pem key to .ppk format).
3. **Set Key Permissions (Linux/macOS):**
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved your .pem file.
   - Change its permissions: chmod 400 your-key-pair-name.pem
4. **Connect via SSH:**
   - Use the command:\*\* ssh -i /path/to/your/key-pair-name.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS
   - Replace /path/to/your/key-pair-name.pem with the actual path to your key file.
   - Replace YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS with the actual public IP or DNS of your EC2 instance.
   - The default username for Amazon Linux is ec2-user.

- Once connected to EC2 instance: update system's package list.  
   `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 
  `

## **WEB SERVER SETUP (Nginx)**

### **INSTALL NGINX**

- To install nginx web server: `sudo apt install nginx -y`
- Confirm nginx is installed: `nginx -v`
- Start Nginx Service: `sudo systemctl start nginx`
- Enable Nginx to Start on Boot: `sudo systemctl enable nginx`
- Check Nginx Status: `sudo systemctl status nginx`  
  You should see "active (running)" in the output.

## **DEPLOYMENT**

### The default web root for Nginx on Ubuntu is /var/www/html/.

- Navigate to the web root: `cd /var/www/html/`

- Remove the default Nginx welcome page (optional, but good practice before deploying your own):
  `sudo rm index.nginx-debian.html`
- Create your own index.html (or upload your website files): `sudo vi index.html`
- Set Permissions (Important!): Ensure Nginx has the necessary permissions to read your files. The default www-data user/group is typically used by Nginx.

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
```

- Restart Nginx (good practice after content changes, though often not strictly necessary for simple file changes in the default root): `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

- Refresh your browser. You should now see your custom HTML page.

## Get a custom domain/Hostname.

- Create an account with [https://noip.com](https://noip.com/)
- Sign up and create a hostname on no-ip, the ip address should also be the public ec2 instance ip address.
-

## Secure with Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL (Certbot) to configure https.

To secure an Ubuntu machine with SSL, you'll typically use Let's Encrypt certificates and Certbot.  
**Web Server:**
You'll need a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) installed and configured on your Ubuntu server.
**Domain Name:**
You need a domain name registered and pointing to your server's IP address.  
**Install Certbot:**.

- Update your system's package list: `sudo apt update`.
- Install Certbot: `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache` (for Apache) or `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx` (for Nginx).

**Obtain an SSL Certificate:**

- For Apache: `sudo certbot --apache`.
- For Nginx: `sudo certbot --nginx`.
  - This will bring about a prompt where you should input your email address then two yes/no questions, just input y (for yes) then it will ask you to input the domain name, so just paste the subdomain/hostname you created on no-ip, wait for it to deploy the certificate successfully and access it on your browser. And that is all

Certbot will guide you through obtaining certificates from Let's Encrypt and automatically update your web server's configuration to use them.
